# Test task from Integrity Vision

##Concatenated Words
The file called “words.txt” contains a sorted list of
approximately 173,000 words. The words are listed one word per line, do not contain spaces,
and are all lowercase.
The task is to write a program that reads the file and provides the following:
 -  the longest concatenated word (that is, the longest word that is comprised entirely of shorter words in the file)
 -  the 2nd longest concatenated word
 -  the total count of all the concatenated words in the file
